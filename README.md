# That's cool.. But how do I use this?
Fortunately theres a tutorial:

- Clone the repo:
```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Qquaded/Kinemium-Engine.git```

- Get zune *(skip this step if you have it already installed.)*<br>
https://zune.sh/guides/install

- Run the engine<br>
```zune run engine```<br>
*This tutorial works with both Linux and Windows, MacOS support is coming soon.*

# Commands
Kinemium provides with several flags you can run with ```zune run game```<br>
- headless (lets you run the engine without graphics)<br>
- server (lets you run a server version of the engine, this is used for games and such)<br>
- client (lets you run a client, it removes all the core UI only)<br>
- kilang (lets you run kilang code in the terminal, you can add this flag with any other flag and it will still work)<br>
- editor (enables studio UI)

# Multiplayer
Kinemium provides multiplayer support with the ```server``` and ```client``` flags:

Making a server with an address and port:<br>
```zune run game --server --address 0.0.0.0 --port 1234 --auth_token your_token```<br>

Connecting a client:<br>
```zune run game --client --address server_ip --port 1234 --auth_token your_token```<br>

You can also just do --server and --client without any arguments and it will run on localhost.

Running live on localhost:<br>
```zune run game --server```<br>
Connect a client:<br>
```zune run game --client```<br>

# Editor
Kinemium has a built-in editor GUI that lets you playtest, script, build, and edit objects.

Enabling Editor mode:<br>
```zune run game --editor```<br>
Running server with editor mode<br>
```zune run game --server --editor```<br>

# Examples
example command with a flag:<br>
```zune run game --client```<br>
```zune run game --client --kilang```<br>
```zune run game --server --kilang```<br>
```zune run game --headless```<br>

# How do I add scripts?
Once you clone the github repo, you will find a folder called ```sandboxed``` inside the engine *(src)*<br>
There are a set of predefined scripts in there as examples, but you can change any of them.

# Can I make my games have modding support?
Yes! there is a modding service called KinemiumModService (said up there)<br>
This lets you add mods to your game, and you can set the environment of your said mods!
